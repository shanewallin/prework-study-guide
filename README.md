# <Prework Study Guide>

## This project is a pre work study guide for the coding academy at UT.



- The purpose of this project is to give a breif oversight and guide to the initial topics that were covered in the prework assignment 
- I made this project to gain more experience and a better understanding of the topics that are covered within. 
- This project neatly organizes this information into an easy to read formant, and also provides the option of randomly selecting a topic to study first if you open the DevTools console. 
- I learned how to create a webpage and the basic elements that come together to give the page structre, style, and functionality!
